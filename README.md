# Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of Q-Learning and Approximate Q-Learning applied to two domains: **Frozen Lake** and **CartPole**. These experiments were conducted as part of the course project to explore reinforcement learning techniques.

## Files in this Repository

- **`FrozenLake_Description.ipynb`**: Detailed explanation and implementation of Q-Learning for the Frozen Lake environment.
- **`CartPole_Description.ipynb`**: Detailed explanation and implementation of Approximate Q-Learning for the CartPole environment.
- **`Q_Learning_FrozenLake.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with the Q-Learning implementation and results for Frozen Lake.
- **`Approx_Q_Learning_CartPole.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with the Approximate Q-Learning implementation and results for CartPole.
- **`tests.ipynb`**: Notebook containing all the test results and comparisons for the project.

## Project Summary

- **Domains**:
  - **Frozen Lake**: A discrete environment where the agent learns to navigate from the starting position to the goal without falling into holes.
  - **CartPole**: A continuous environment where the agent learns to balance a pole on a moving cart by applying forces.

- **Reinforcement Learning Methods**:
  - Q-Learning: A model-free RL algorithm using a Q-table for discrete states.
  - Approximate Q-Learning: A model-free RL algorithm using function approximation for continuous state spaces.

## Results

- Frozen Lake: Tested with Q-Learning and Approximate Q-Learning.
- CartPole: Tested with Approximate Q-Learning.
